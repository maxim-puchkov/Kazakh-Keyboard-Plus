#  Kazakh Keyboard Plus
Kazakh Keyboard Plus is a custom Kazakh keyboard for iPhone that many times reached the No. 1 position in the Kazakh App Store. It provides the same functionality as a standard Russian iPhone keyboard, as well as an additional row of Kazakh letters. Moreover, the user can customize symbolic keyboard to use any other symbol or emoji. 

> __Note:__ This app is no longer available on App Store because built-in Kazakh keyboard was added to iOS 13.
